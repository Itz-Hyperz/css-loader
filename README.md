# css-loader
This is a "loader" made in CSS

---

In order for this to work, you will need to add this code to your html:

```
<a href="" target="_blank">
  <div class="box">
    <div class="innerBox"></div>
  </div>
</a>
```

I'm trying to become more advanced in CSS, this is one of my slightly more advanced creations.
